# IMPORTANT NOTE
THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL FLATPAK FOR BEEPER. USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL!

# WORK IN PROGRESS
This project is very much a work in progress. I am still very new to Flatpak packaging, so I have not tested uploading this to a flathub repository. 

The current process to install this package is:
1. Run the installBeeper shell script

To remove the package:
1. Run the uninstallBeeper shell script
